# ASSIGNMENTS

Create a react application that integrates Apollo Client and connects to https://api.spacex.land/graphql/. Then display all the past SpaceX missions with image, name, and relevant data the API provides in a grid layout. When you click on a box it should go to a different page where it will show details of the rocket used.

Since the SpaceX API provides lots of data about its launches we are not picky about what would you display, make your own choice of few items.
